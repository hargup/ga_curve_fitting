ga_curve_fitting
================

This was an attempt to try to solve the curve fitting problem by using genetic algorithms. This takes a pool of random lines and minizes a modified root mean square error in the population. The method worked quite well and can be extended to other types of curves. Note that the last code commit was made in April 2014 and I'm not actively working on this.
